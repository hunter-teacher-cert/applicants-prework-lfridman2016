  Exercise 5  
One way to calculate e^x is to use the infinite series expansion:

The ith term in the series is xi / i!.

Write a method called myexp that takes x and n as parameters and estimates e^x by adding the first n terms of this series. You can use the factorial method from Section 6.7 or your iterative version from the previous exercise.
